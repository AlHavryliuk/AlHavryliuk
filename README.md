I like programming since a childhood and gradually improve my skills. I always learn new technologies and open for challenging tasks. I’m looking for full time projects. Please reach me if you have one.

One of my recent projects was real-time web application. 
It allowed multiple users to participate in online events. Another project allowed to sync data with third party providers.
